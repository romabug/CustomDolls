The gown you see in the photos is the gown you will receive. Other sites use magazine photos or photos that are not their own.</li><li>Then, there’s <strong>availability</strong>.  We stock over 4,000 dresses in our warehouse in Dayton, Ohio, and most dresses can be shipped out the next day. </li><li>Then, of course, there’s <strong>convenience</strong>.  You can shop in the comfort of your own home or office.  You don’t even have to dress up (unless, of course, you’re at the office).  You can shop for your dress in a robe and slippers with your hair in rollers, if you want, while drinking your favorite beverage.  And let’s not forget your friends and family.  People who you might want to look at your dress, or help you decide between two or three dresses.  They can look at your choice(s) from their home or office, at their convenience.</li><li>Not only will your shopping experience with us be convenient, it will be <strong>worry free</strong>.  We have bridal sales consultants available 24 hours a day to help you find the perfect dress for the perfect price.  You can talk with them by phone (1-866-MY-GOWNS) or through our unique online chat system.  Either way, your questions will be answered in a friendly, knowledgeable manner.</li><li>Next, we offer <strong>peace of mind</strong>.  We have been in the bridal business for over 25 years, and have thousands of <a href="http://customdolls.com.au/admin/testimonials.asp">Testimonials</a> from happy, satisfied brides.  The gown you see in the photos is the gown you will receive.  Also, unlike traditional bridal shops and other online bridal companies, we welcome exchanges and returns so you can purchase your dream dress hassle-free. Every purchase is backed by a <a href="http://customdolls.com.au/admin/policy.asp">Money Back Guarantee</a>.</li><li>Finally, there’s <strong>price</strong>.  At Bridal Online you get brand new, first quality dresses at up to 80% off bridal shop prices.  We manufacturer our own dresses, and wholesale them to high end bridal shops.  We have the same dresses that are in local bridal shops.  The reason that our prices are so low is because we do not have the overhead of a bridal shop.  We are online only, that is the reason we have great prices. </li></ul><p>With over 1,000 <a href="http://customdolls.com.au/admin/testimonials.asp">Testimonials</a> from happy, satisfied brides, we are sure to make your dream wedding possible at an affordable price.</p><p>A word about eBay. eBay is, perhaps, the largest marketplace in the world. And terrific savings can be had for many items. However, wedding dresses are not one of them. This has nothing to do with eBay, itself, but rather some unscrupulous sellers. If you're seriously thinking about purchasing your wedding dress on eBay, we urge you to read the following <strong><a href="http://customdolls.com.au/admin/ebay.asp">case study</a></strong> before you make a bid.</p><p>If you have any further questions, we have bridal sales consultants available 24 hours a day to help.

Our employees receive your name, items on your order and shipping address ONLY.  You have a better chance of having some one else having your credit card number going to a store than typing it directly on your computer.  You are also guaranteed your purchase through your credit card, PayPal and Google.</p><p>Please see our <a href="http://customdolls.com.au/admin/PrivacyPolicy.asp">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p><p><a href="http://customdolls.com.au/admin/#top">Back to Top</a></p><hr /><h3><br />Can I return the dress if I don't like it?<a name="return"></a></h3><p>Yes, our return policy is under the <a href="http://customdolls.com.au/admin/policy.asp">Policy</a> button above.  All you need to do is call us for an authorization code and return the dress within three calendar days counting the day you receive your dress to get your money back (less a 10% re-stocking and shipping fee).  This is a minor risk for a great savings.  That means you need to ship it in three days, not for us to receive it in three days.  As long as the dress is in a new condition, not a custom dress and not expedited (shipped faster than regular or ground), we will happily refund your payment.</p><p>You can also <a href="http://customdolls.com.au/admin/policy.asp">exchange</a> your purchase for another dress, size or color with no re-stocking fee.</p><p><a href="http://customdolls.com.au/admin/#top">Back to Top</a></p><hr /><h3><br />What if I order more than one gown, and I return the others?<a name="return_multiples"></a></h3><p>If you order more than one gown, as long as you keep one gown you will be given a full refund on one gown, and be charged a 10% (minimum $29) restocking fee on the other gowns that are returned. For example, if you order three gowns and return 2 gowns, you will get a full refund on one gown and be charged a restocking fee on the other.

Please email us at <a href="mailto:info@bridalonlinestore.com">info@bridalonlinestore.com</a> with your name and address and what colors you are wanting to see, and we will send them right out.</p><p>Please understand that these swatches are to be used only as a guide for the colors offered. Colors may vary due to dye lots and different types of fabric. Please use these swatches as a general example, as the actual gown's color may vary from that of the swatch.</p><p>We cannot guarantee gown colors to match exactly to the swatches. Dye lot variations do exist. Please use these swatches only as a reference, as they may not represent the final color of the gown.</p><p><a href="http://customdolls.com.au/admin/#top">Back to Top</a></p><hr /><h3><br />Can I return a dress that I custom ordered as a zipper back?<a name="returnZipper"></a></h3><p>If the gown normally comes in a lace-up back and we have made it a zipper back, it would be considered a custom and not returnable or exchangeable.

We do recommend that you approve the dress before any alterations, as the dress will not be returnable once the alterations have been completed.</p><p>Please see our <a href="http://customdolls.com.au/admin/Alterations.asp">Alterations Page</a> for more information.</p><p><br /><a href="http://customdolls.com.au/admin/#top">Back to Top</a></p><hr /><h3><br />I don't have a PayPal account, can I use my credit card online?<a name="creditcard"></a></h3><p>Yes, you are only using the service PayPal provides to process your credit card, you do not have to sign up with PayPal.  We actually do not recommend signing up for PayPal if you haven't already done so.  You are still covered with their insurance, and it will take 3-5 days to verify your information.  You might want to consider creating a PayPal account in the future if you do a lot of internet shopping.  </p><p>After you add all your items to your shopping cart, click on secure checkout.  You will be forwarded to the PayPal screen with payment to IBC (This is our parent company, International Bridal Company).  Depending on your browser, you will see on your screen something similar to:</p><div style="COLOR: #000000" id="xptContentOuter"><table id="table588" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><div style="COLOR: #000000" id="xptContentMain"><form method="post" action="https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr"><table id="table589" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tbody><tr><td class="topSpacer" width="150"><img onmouseover="function onmouseover()
