<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: What is the difference between a fully  customized bobblehead and a standard body bobblehead?</strong><br />
A: Fully customized bobbleheads allow  customers to modify anything and everything on the doll from head to toe,  whereas a standard bodies allow you to modify the head and the colors of the  clothing. The same craftsmanship is used on both styles.</p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: Do you ship internationally?<br />
</strong>A: Yes, we ship whereever you want us to.  It's that simple. emai customerservice@custombobbleheads.com if you have any  questions. We'd be glad to help.</p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: How do you ensure that I will love my  bobblehead? </strong><br />
A: Our proofing process allows you to have  full control over the sculpting and painting of your custom  bobblehead.&nbsp;After each stage of the production process, you will be able  to approve or deny the results.&nbsp;If you approve a stage, we will move  forward with the production process.&nbsp;If you deny it, just tell us what to  change and we will redo it until you are happy.&nbsp;This helps to guarantee  your satisfaction since you'd be directly involved in every step of the  production process!</p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: What is &quot;Proofing&quot;? </strong><br />
A: This is the interaction between the  customer and the artist in which the customer must give the okay on the custom  made bobblehead prior to shipping. This communication is done via email soon  after the purchase of most bobbleheads (the exception being those where the customer  selected 'Faster' or 'Fastest' for a sculpting option).</p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: When is there a proofing process? </strong><br />
A: Proofing is available to you at no  charge on all standard body bobbleheads and fully customizable bobbleheads with  'Standard' Sculpting and 'Fast' Sculpting options.&nbsp;Proofing is not  available on our 'Faster' Sculpting and 'Fastest' Sculpting options because of  the time the proofing process adds to the production schedule.&nbsp;Please keep  in mind that the ship date of your doll is directly affected by the amount of  changes required on your bobblehead.</p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: Can I order duplicates of my custom  bobblehead? </strong><br />
A: Absolutely!&nbsp;In fact, we give  discounted rates for dolls ordered in any quantity over 1. How sweet is that?!  For example, the base price of a fully customized single doll is $144.95, 1-5  duplicates would be only $44.95 each, 6-10 duplicates are only $40.95 each, and  11-49 are only $35.95 each. Thats as much as 75% off the original doll! At  these prices, make sure to get one for everyone!</p>
<p class="STYLE2">*Please note - duplicate pricing can only  be applied to your order BEFORE the molding &amp; casting stage of your order.  Make sure to add duplicates to your order as soon as possible to get the  duplicate pricing.</p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: How are you able to offer duplicates at  such low prices? </strong><br />
A: During the sculpting process of your  original doll, every detail is sculpted by hand. This is a very time-consuming  process. Once you have approved this doll, we are able to make a mold of it  which allows us to quickly and accurately create duplicates. We pass this  savings on to you in order to allow you to get multiple dolls for everyone who  thinks your bobblehead is as cool as you do. But remember, we destroy the molds  after the original ships...so make sure to order your duplicates BEFORE the  molding &amp; casting stage of your order.</p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: What if I need to put together a very  large custom order? </strong><br />
A: We would be glad to assist in getting  you exactly what is required. If you need to order a large number of custom  bobbleheads then customer support is here to help.&nbsp;Just give us a call at  1-770-781-9850 and let us know what we can do for you.</p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: Do I get a proof?</strong><br />
A: If you would like to see a picture  proof, we can email you a picture proof. Please include that in your order.  Once the proof is emailed to the customer, we must receive a response within 24  hours, otherwise the proof is considered approved and the order will be  shipped. It is the customer's responsibility to provide us with a working email  address. It is also advised to add service@customdolls.com.au to your contact  list to ensure the email does not go to your Spam folder.</p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: Will I received proof if I order super  rush such as 12days,10days or 7days?</strong><br />
A: We will do our best to email proofs for  rush orders with less than 2 weeks time to complete but cannot guarantee it.  Affected are 12days, 10days, 8days and 7days rush service.</p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: What type of proof will I receive?</strong><br />
A: You will receive a fully painted clay  doll as proof, not clay or semi-finished clay model which makes it difficult to  make a good comparison. see examples:</p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: Can I put my friend’s face on the bobble  head?</strong><br />
A: Yes. In fact, that is what Headbobble  does. We create a custom bobble head based on your picture.</p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: How long does it take to make a custom  doll?</strong><br />
A: Our standard delivery is 4-6 weeks.  Meaning you will receive your bobble head order within 6 weeks from the time we  receive adequate pictures.</p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: I don’t have a side profile. I only have  a front picture. Is that ok?</strong><br />
A: Yes, we can use only the front picture  as long as it is a good, straight-on head shot. The person’s head should NOT be  tilted or turned in any direction and is eye-level with the camera.</p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: I want to make sure I’m not ordering the  generic bobble head shown on your website. When do I upload my photos?    </strong><br />
A: You may also email your pictures to us.  In which case, you should still complete your order first to receive order  number which you should reference in your email.</p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: I want a long-sleeved shirt instead of a  T-shirt. Can I change the clothes on one of the standard bodies?</strong><br />
A: Yes you can. That change requires a new  mold and thus would be a full custom body. Any change you make that alters the  mold would deem it a full custom body and the cost for a simple full custom  body is different. Other examples include, changing the position of the hands/arms/legs  and putting something in the hand.</p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: Can you make dolls of famous people?</strong><br />
A: Generally, we cannot make dolls of any  person who profits from their own image, including professional athletes,  musicians and actors. However, we are allowed to make dolls of political  figures and famous athletes.</p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: What body styles do you offer?</strong><br />
  A: We offer more than 300 body types that  are made from molds. If none of those are what you want, we also offer a  completely custom body type. We have made hundreds of different body styles, so  we can definitely create the style you are looking for!<br />
The custom-body doll is sculpted by hand to  meet your specifications. You can have us match the pose, clothing and  accessories for the body either from a photograph or a detailed description. Either  provide pictures of the body style you would like or describe it in the Special  Instructions box on the Order Form. </p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: I’m uploading a picture, do I still have  to choose the hair, eye and skin color?</strong><br />
A: Yes. Sometimes we receive black and  white pictures. Or the lighting in the picture can make the person’s hair look  darker/lighter than it really is. Most of the time we cannot tell what eye  color the person has. And for several other reasons, we feel it best to leave the  guess work out and ask our customers to tell us what color to paint the bobble  head. </p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q: I don’t know how to send my pictures  through the internet. Can I mail them to you?</strong><br />
A: Yes, Please complete your order online  to receive an Email of Order Confirmation. Print out your order  confirmation,&nbsp;and then mail that along with your pictures.&nbsp;For time  sensitive orders, it is suggested that your pictures fit our criteria so we  don’t have to wait for additional photos. If you would like your pictures  returned to you, please also include a self-addressed stamped envelope. Once  they are mailed, our responsibilities has ended and it is up to the postal  office for delivery.</p>
<p class="STYLE2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="STYLE2"><strong>Q:What will my clay doll look like?</strong><br />
A: We hand paint the doll to match your  exact specifications, whether it is a high school baseball uniform, a corporate  logo, or a detailed tattoo. We will paint as close a replica as we can, but  some small images may be too tiny on the doll itself to allow much detail. Either  provide pictures of the body colors and decorations you would like or describe  them in the Special Instructions box on the Order Form.We offer more than 300  body types that are made from molds. If none of those are what you want, we  also offer a completely custom body type. We have made hundreds of different  body styles, so we can definitely create the style you are looking for!
