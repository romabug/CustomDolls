<p class="STYLE2"><br /><font size="4" face="times new roman,times,serif">If you do not want to choose a standard body from our catalogue but rather use your own images of another body (your own?), this is also possible.<br /><br />You can use any picture of a body, e.g. you in action while skiing, a snow boarder, a special uniform, your favorite team jerseyâ€¦..almost anything is achievable.<br /><br />The more images you could send us (back, front, left side, right side) the better and more precise we can make this 3d Mini Me look-a-like for you!<br /><br />
How would you like to have a custom doll of yourself? Or your boss, wife, or friend? Now you can! We are now offering a new custom, personalized bobblehead service whereby our professional sculptors will create your very own bobble doll, to your specifications.  <br />
